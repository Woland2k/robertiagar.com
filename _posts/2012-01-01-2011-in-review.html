<p>The WordPress.com stats helper monkeys prepared a 2011 annual report for this blog.</p>
<p><a href="/2011/annual-report/"><img src="assets/emailteaser.jpg" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>Here's an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>A New York City subway train holds 1,200 people. This blog was viewed about <strong>4,200</strong> times in 2011. If it were a NYC subway train, it would take about 4 trips to carry that many people.</p></blockquote>
