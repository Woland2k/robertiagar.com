<p>last night i found something interesting, something that really impressed me.</p>
<p>i was with her watching a movie. all of a sudden i get this weird, but nice, sensation. i was taken back a brief moment to day i finaly decided to call her and talk about us. all of the emotions that where inside of me came back, for a short, brief moment. </p>
<p>i'm sure i can explain it, but there i was, standing in the laboratory of systems theory. the proffesor was talking about something related to the subject. i didn't pay that much attention. i was distracted by my own thoughts, my thoughts of her...</p>
<p>all of this happened in a split second. then i came back and she was there, smiling, looking at me how she's always had. i'm lucky to have her, and even more lucky to get her back...</p>
