<p>I've started work on my website. So far so good. I haven't quite figure out what will be on it, but I have a general idea where I'm going with it. I'll be making a custom blog and RSS just to learn how to create a .NET Blog. I know there are framework already out there that do this, but I want to do this for myself. How hard can it be?</p>
<p>The site will also function as an online resume and will feature all my personal projects or project ideas that I had, have and going to have in the future. I'm not sharing my work so far. Not until I'm happy with the overall design and features.</p>
<p>In the mean time, I've posted some new photographs over at <a href="http://500px.com/RobertIagar">500px</a>. The one below is my favorite.</p>
