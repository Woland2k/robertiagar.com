<p>I've been recently adding a lot to a set on my soundcloud page. Not sure if you guys have heard it, but these tunes help me stay focused. I know, you might be thinking how on earth can dubstep keep a man focus? It just works for me.</p>
<p>Honorable mentions:</p>
<p>And let's not forget about my all time favorite, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/goingquantum">The Going Quantum Podcast</a>:</p>
