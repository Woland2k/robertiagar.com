<p>Once in a while I stumble upon a piece of great music. Today or last night to be more specific, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MonstercatMedia">Monstercat Media</a> released the following track. Go ahead I'll wait until you listen to it.  [youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttxwkkuGq-4] One of the best dubstep track I've heard in a while. And I have a pretty big <a href="https://soundcloud.com/robert-iagar/sets/great-dub">set</a> on my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/robert-iagar/">soundcloud</a>.  I'm curious to hear your opinion about it. Leave a comment below.</p>
