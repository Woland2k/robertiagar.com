<p>the site is moving along great. most of the initial design is done, though there's pretty much work on the back-end. i'm trying to build a blog platform on ASP.NET which is not quite that easy, but I learn. should be fun to do.</p>
<p>on a different, but related to the tile note, I've taken some new pictures. you'll find them on my <a href="http://500px.com/RobertIagar">500px profile</a></p>
<p>as usual here's a preview: <a href="http://500px.com/photo/58452114">  <img alt="bloom by Robert Iagar on 500px.com" border="0" src="assets/4.jpg" /></a><br /><span style="font-size:120%;">  <a href="http://500px.com/photo/58452114">bloom</a>  by   <a href="http://500px.com/RobertIagar">Robert Iagar</a></span></p>
<p>more updates on the way...</p>
<p>subscribe. like. comment.</p>
