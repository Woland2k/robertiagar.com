<p>Have you ever wondered how do some movies have such cool OS themes and such? Well I have and I think I found out how they do it. It’s either flash or how I’m trying to do it in WPF. WPFs easy ability to customize UI and pretty much everything else helps you to achieve this. I’ll try to come up with some UI and some working stuff.</p>
<p>This will be a perfect excuse to dive into Styling, Themes and such in WPF. It’ll be a learning experience for me as well, as I’m a relative new user to the technology. Stay tuned.</p>
