<p dir="ltr">We all had a point in or our lives when our brain refused to function poor properly. Whether we were drunk or high or somewhere in between, it stopped working.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Right now I'm trying to come up with something to say or to write rather and nothing productive comes out. Sure, you are reading this and this something did came out of my brain, but after reading you'll probably wonder why on Earth you read this in the first place. It's just some random text on the internet.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you got here by accident, you my dear friend are bored. If you wanted to read this by your own will, thank you.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Either way, sorry I wasted your time.</p>
