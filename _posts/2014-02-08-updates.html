<p>I've added a lot more photos and sadly I've not worked on my website in a while. I did work on my bachelors degree and I'm starting to live Windows Azure Mobile Services. Sending raw notifications with a custom payload is really great. Not sure though that I'm using best practices, but it's coming along great.</p>
