This website has been built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), themed using [mediator](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator) jekyll theme, hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com), with the domain bought and managed at [DNSimple](http://dnsimple.com).

You can find the source code in my GitHub [repository](https://github.com/robertiagar/robertiagar-website). You can [fork](https://github.com/robertiagar/robertiagar-website/fork) it, but all *.md files are my own.

You can find the source code for Jekyll at [github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).

Enjoy!
